<p> Roblox is, how the creators describe it, <a href="https://corporate.roblox.com/parents/"> a global platform where millions of players gather together daily to create, imagine and share new experiences with friends and other players alike in immersive, user-generated worlds. </a> It combines gaming and social media into a huge, centralized hub where people can interact and share with each other. First released in 2006, the game has grown exponentially over these last couple of years, especially with kids, as it's free to play and easily accesible. </p>

<p> It has continuously built its focus for the metaverse, involving voice and video chat, a complex avatar creation system allowing users for a wide range of personalization options, and a wide diversity on the games one can find, from games meant to appeal children to complex, story rich games focused for young adults.</p>
