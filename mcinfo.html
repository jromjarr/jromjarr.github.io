<p> Released in a beta state in 2009, Minecraft is a sandbox game which is currently the world's best selling game. In it, users explore a procedurrally generated world, which varies completely from every world the user makes. It features 2 different modes; survival, which throws the player into the world withno tools, making them explore and use the world around them to shape their own personalized experience: and creative, which gives the player every single type of item found in the game, allowing them to freely use their creativity and make whatever is in their heart's desire. </p>

<p> Since 2018, the game has been focusing on uniting players together, since its "Better Together" update allowed players to play together even if they were on different platforms for the first time, including Xbox, mobile, PC, and later on PlayStation players. This was the first time a video game allowed players to be in a multiplayer game, disregarding their platform of choice. </p>
